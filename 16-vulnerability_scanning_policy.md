# 16. Vulnerability Scanning Policy

Health Note is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. Health Note utilizes OPenVAS to consistently scan, identify, and address vulnerabilities on our systems. We also utilize Amazon Guard Duty in our AWS environment for intelligent threat detection and continuous monitoring.  HealthNote utilizes the NPM audit functionality to scan for vulnerabilities in source code.
