# 16. Vulnerability Scanning Policy

Health Note is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. Health Note utilizes OpenVAS to consistently scan, identify, and address vulnerabilities on our systems. We also utilize Amazon Guard Duty in our AWS environment for intelligent threat detection and continuous monitoring.  Health Note utilizes the Vanta and NPM audit functionality to scan for vulnerabilities in source code.

## 16.1 Applicable Standards

## 16.1.1 Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework

* 10.m - Control of Technical Vulnerabilities

## 16.1.2 Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

* 164.308(a)(8) - HIPAA Security Rule Evaluation

## 16.2 Vulnerability Scanning Policy

1. OpenVAS is performed by the Health Note Security Officer, or an authorized delegate of the Security Officer.
2. OpenVAS is used to monitor all internal IP addresses (servers, VMs, etc) on Health Note networks.
3. Frequency of scanning is as follows:
    * on a weekly basis;
    * after every production deployment.
4. Reviewing OpenVAS Assessment Report, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, is the responsibility of the Health Note Security Officer. The process for reviewing OpenVAS Assessment Report is outlined below:
    * The Security Officer initiates the review of an OpenVAS Assessment Report by opening the **OpenVAS Assessment Report Review Google Form** [here](https://forms.gle/Mnhf7UnVFGv2PqYJA). 
    * The Security Officer, or a Health Note Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to review the OpenVAS Assessment Report.
    * Findings are reviewed for actionable items to resolve potential security issues discovered by OpenVAS.  
    * Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Form. If the Form is rejected, it goes back for further review.
    * If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Form as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.

5. NPM audit is ran on a monthly basis to scan for vulnerabilities in the source code. The process for reviewing the NPM audit results is outlined below:
    * The Security Officer initiates the review of the NPM audit report by opening the Code (NPM Audit) Review Form [here](https://forms.gle/7pQXvZXso8s1jHnq7).
    * The Security Officer, or a Health Note Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to review the NPM audit results.
    * Findings are reviewed for actionable items to remediate vulnerabilities found. Appropriate staff are notified to implement changes required to remediate vulnerabilities found.
    * Remediation actions are documented in the form.
6. Vanta automatically scans for vulnerabilities in the source code every 24 hours.

7. All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by Health Note. Vulnerability report review is monitored on a quarterly basis by reviewing the Google Form data to assess compliance with above policy.

8. This vulnerability policy is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer.
