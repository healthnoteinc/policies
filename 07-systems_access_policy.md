# 7. System Access Policy

Access to Health Note systems and applications is limited for all users, including but not limited to workforce members, volunteers, business associates, contracted providers, and consultants. Access by any other entity is allowable only on a minimum necessary basis. All users are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized use or access of the organization's information systems. These safeguards have been established to address the HIPAA Security regulations including the following:

## 7.2 Access Establishment and Modification

1. Requests for access to Health Note systems and applications are made formally using the following process:
  1. A Health Note workforce member initiates the access request by filling out a **Systems Access Form** [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdus2wN2WHjbj0JBal2aG6Z8NmguTP7am1GCmZAgPvb7zSKaw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
     * User identities must be verified prior to granting access to new accounts.
     * Identity verification must be done in person where possible; for remote employees, identities must be verified over the phone.
     * For new accounts, the method used to verify the user's identity must be recorded on the Systems Access Form.
  2. The Security Officer or Privacy Officer will review access to systems as dictated by the employee's job title. If additional access is required outside of the minimum necessary to perform job functions, the requester must include a description of why the additional access is required as part of the access request.
  3. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the form. If the form is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
  4. If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then updates the Systems Access Form as Done, adding any pertinent notes required. The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) then grants requested access.
     * New accounts will be created with a temporary secure password that meets all requirements from [ยง7.12](#7.12-password-management), which must be changed on the initial login.
     * All password exchanges must occur over an authenticated channel.
     * For non-production systems, access grants are accomplished by leveraging the access control mechanisms built into those systems. Account management for non-production systems may be delegated to a Health Note employee at the discretion of the Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or CTO.
2. Access is not granted until receipt, review, and approval by the Health Note Security Officer or Privacy Officer.
3. The request for access is retained for future reference.
4. All access to Health Note systems and services is reviewed and updated on a bi-annual basis to ensure proper authorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The form used to conduct account review is on Google Drive.  A security consultant is designated by the Security Officer or CTO to perform the access review.
5. Any Health Note workforce member can request change of access using the process outlined in [ยง7.2 paragraph 1](#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification).
6. Access to production systems is controlled using centralized user management and authentication.
7. Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business purposes.
   * Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to ensure temporary accounts are not left unnecessarily.
   * Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.
8. In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content, identification and authentication may not be required. This is the responsibility of Health Note Customers to define, and not Health Note.
9. Privileged users must first access systems using standard, unique user accounts before switching to privileged users and performing privileged tasks.
   * For production systems, this is enforced by creating non-privileged user accounts that must invoke `sudo` to perform privileged tasks.
   * Rights for privileged accounts are granted by the Security Officer or Privacy Officer using the process outlined in [ยง7.2 paragraph 1](#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification).
10. All application to application communication using service accounts is restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are used to limit account access across applications and systems.
11. Generic accounts are not allowed on Health Note systems.
12. In cases of increased risk or known attempted unauthorized access, immediate steps are taken by the Security and Privacy Officer to limit access and reduce risk of unauthorized access.
13. Direct system to system, system to application, and application to application authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict access.

## 7.3 Workforce Clearance

1. The level of security assigned to a user to the organization's information systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user's job classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.
2. All access requests are treated on a "least-access principle."
3. Health Note maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data. As such, Health Note, including all workforce members, does not readily have access to any ePHI.
4. All workforce members are subject to a background check before access is granted to information systems, facilties, and/or ePHI.

## 7.4 Access Authorization

1. Role based access categories for each Health Note system and application are pre-approved by the Security Officer, or an authorized delegate of the Security Officer.  Defined roles can be referenced in Appendix 1 of the systems access policy.
2. Health Note utilizes hardware and software firewalls to segment data, prevent unauthorized access, and monitor traffic for denial of service attacks.

## 7.5 Person or Entity Authentication

1. Each workforce member has and uses a unique user ID and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.
2. Each Customer and Partner has and uses a unique user ID and password that identifies him/her as the user of the information system.

## 7.6 Unique User Identification

1. Access to the Health Note Platform systems and applications is controlled by requiring unique User Login IDs and passwords for each individual user and developer.
2. Passwords requirements mandate strong password controls (see below).
3. Passwords are not displayed at any time and are not transmitted or stored in plain text.
4. Default accounts on all production systems, including root, are disabled.
5. Shared accounts are not allowed within Health Note systems or networks.
6. Automated log-on configurations that store user passwords or bypass password entry are not permitted for use with Health Note workstations or production systems.

## 7.7 Automatic Logoff

1. Users are required to make information systems inaccessible by any other individual when unattended by the users (ex. by using a password protected screen saver or logging off the system).
2. Information systems automatically log users off or lock with password protected screen saver systems after 15 minutes of inactivity.
3. The Security Officer pre-approves exceptions to automatic log off requirements.

## 7.8 Employee Workstation Use

   * All data in transit over wireless is encrypted using WPA2 encryption;
   * Passwords are rotated on a regular basis, presently quarterly. This process is managed by the Health Note Security Officer.

## 7.10 Employee Termination Procedures

1. The Human Resources Department (or other designated department), users, and their supervisors are required to notify the Security Officer upon completion and/or termination of access needs and facilitating completion of the "Termination Checklist".
2. The Human Resources Department, users, and supervisors are required to notify the Security Officer to terminate a user's access rights if there is evidence or reason to believe the following (these incidents are also reported on an incident report and is filed with the Privacy Officer):
   * The user has been using their access rights inappropriately;
   * A user's password has been compromised (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as the individual compromising the original password);
   * An unauthorized individual is utilizing a user's User Login ID and password (a new password may be provided to the user if the user is not identified as providing the unauthorized individual with the User Login ID and password).
3. The Security Officer will terminate users' access rights immediately upon notification, and will coordinate with the appropriate Health Note employees to terminate access to any non-production systems managed by those employees.
4. The Security Officer audits and may terminate access of users that have not logged into organization's information systems/applications for an extended period of time.

## 7.11 Paper Records

Health Note does not use paper records for any sensitive information. Use of paper for recording and storing sensitive data is against Health Note policies.

## 7.12 Password Management
