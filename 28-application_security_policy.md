# 28.0 Application Security Policy

## 28.1 Objective

The policy and associated guidance provide an organized approach for all instances and stages of development initiated for Health Note departments.  Based on the project requirements applications are developed in-house, with a third party, or commercial off the shelf (COTS). This policy will cover all instances to ensure the appropriate security controls are implemented for applications developed for Health Note.

## 28.2 Scope

This policy is applicable to all Health Note applications, systems, and network segments.

The audience for this policy is all Health Note staff.  It also applies for all other types of employees with access to Health Note information and network for contracted services. This includes, but not limited to partners, affiliates, contractors, temporary employees, trainees, and volunteers.  

## 28.3 Policy

Secure development practices will be established, implemented, and documented for all applications developed or purchased to include appropriate security controls to prevent unauthorized access or modification of the system or information coded or stored. 

Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and OWASP Secure Coding guidelines will be followed. 

Operations Personnel will establish the required controls for applications that will access, store, transmit, or manipulate protected and confidential information. These controls are required for all life cycle stages of development. 

- Test environments will be separate from the production environment.
- Separation of duties will be established and monitored to ensure conflicting roles and access to all phases of the development and implementation process is not granted.
- A risk assessment will be performed prior to production for all applications that will store, access, create, and/or transmit confidential or protected information.
