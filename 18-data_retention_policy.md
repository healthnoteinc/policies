# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Health Note understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Health Note is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Health Note has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Health Note Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws

* [Listing of state requirements for medical record retention](http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/appa7-1.pdf)

## 18.2 Data Retention Policy

* Current Health Note Customers have data stored by Health Note as a part of the Health Note Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
  1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
  2. If no response to notice from 18.2 - 1 within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Health Note and/or to have Health Note continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Health Note will work with Customer to determine storage costs.
  3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Health Note within 30 days, Health Note removes data from Health Note systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
