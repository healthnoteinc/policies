# 31.0 Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and  Acceptable Use Policy

## Objective

This policy establishes Health Note guidelines for employee/contractor use of personally owned electronic devices for work-related purposes.

## Scope

The BYOD and Acceptable Use Policy applies to all employees, interns, contractors, vendors and anyone using assets.  Employees/Contractors of Health Note may have the opportunity to use their personal electronic devices for work purposes when authorized in writing, in advance, by the employee/contractor and management. Personal electronic devices include personally owned cellphones, smartphones, tablets, laptops and computers.

The BYOD policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors and any other person using or accessing information or information systems. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the CTO, Head of Engineering, or a designated representative.  The use of personal devices is limited to certain employees/contractors and may be limited based on compatibility of technology.   Furthermore, based on the amount of personally identifiable information (PII) employees work with, management reserves the right to determine which employees can use personally owned devices and which cannot.

# Procedure

## Device protocols

To ensure the security of Health Note information, authorized employees/contractors are required to have anti-virus and mobile device management (MDM) software installed on their personal electronic devices. This MDM software will enforce security policies (i.e. password and encryption requirements) and have the ability to lock, remotely wipe, restart, shutdown, etc. personal electronic devices. Health Note’s IT department must install this software prior to using the personal device for work purposes.

Employees/Contractors may store company-related information only on company contracted storage services (i.e. Google Drive). Employees/Contractors may not use non-approved cloud-based apps or backup that allows company-related data to be transferred to unsecure parties. Employees/Contractors may not use unsecure Internet sites.

## Restrictions on authorized use

While at work, employees/contractors are expected to exercise the same discretion in using their personal devices as is expected for the use of company devices. Health Note policies pertaining to harassment, discrimination, retaliation, trade secrets, confidential information and ethics apply to employee use of personal devices for work-related activities.

Employees/Contractors may not use their personal devices for work purposes during periods of unpaid leave without authorization from management. Health Note reserves the right to deactivate the company’s application and access on the employee’s personal device during periods of unpaid leave.

Family and friends should not use personal devices that are used for company purposes.

## Privacy/company access

No employee using his or her personal device should expect any privacy except that which is governed by law. Health Note has the right, at any time, to monitor and preserve any communications that use the Health Note’s networks in any way, including data, voice mail, telephone logs, Internet use and network traffic, to determine proper use.

Management reserves the right to review or retain personal and company-related data on personal devices or to release the data to government agencies or third parties during an investigation or litigation. Management may review the activity and analyze use patterns and may choose to publicize these data to ensure that Health Note’s resources in these areas are being use according to this policy. Furthermore, no employee may knowingly disable any network software or system identified as a monitoring tool.

## Safety

Employees/Contractors are expected to follow applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations regarding the use of electronic devices at all times.

Employees/Contractors whose job responsibilities include regular or occasional driving are expected to refrain from using their personal devices while driving. Regardless of the circumstances, including slow or stopped traffic, employees/contractors are required to pull off to the side of the road and safely stop the vehicle before placing or accepting a call or texting. Special care should be taken in situations involving traffic, inclement weather or unfamiliar areas.

Employees/Contractors who are charged with traffic violations resulting from the use of their personal devices while driving will be solely responsible for all liabilities that result from such actions.

Employees/Contractors who work in hazardous areas must refrain from using personal devices while at work in those areas, as such use can potentially be a major safety hazard.

## Lost, stolen, hacked or damaged equipment

Employees/Contractors are expected to protect personal devices used for work-related purposes from loss, damage or theft.

In an effort to secure sensitive company data, employees/contractors are required to have “remote-wipe” software installed on their personal devices by the IT department prior to using the devices for work purposes. This software allows the company-related data to be erased remotely in the event the device is lost or stolen. Wiping company data may affect other applications and data.

Health Note will not be responsible for loss or damage of personal applications or data resulting from the use of company applications or the wiping of company information. Employees/Contractors must immediately notify management in the event their personal device is lost, stolen or damaged. If IT is unable to repair the device, the employee will be responsible for the cost of replacement.

Employees/Contractors may receive disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment for damage to personal devices caused willfully by the employee.

## Reporting Security Concerns

The user agrees to report the following immediately:
- If the device is lost or stolen
- If the device has been attacked with malware, a virus or any other suspicious attack
- Any other security concern with regards to company data

## Remote Wiping

While Health Note does not own the device, they do own all company data. Therefore, Health Note reserves the right to remotely wipe the user’s personally owned device at any time. Not only will company data get wiped, but the user’s personal data could be lost as well. The user must understand and accept this risk.

## Termination of employment

Upon resignation or termination of employment, or at any time on request, the employee may be asked to produce the personal device for inspection. All company data on personal devices will be removed by IT upon termination of employment.  Company reserves the right to perform full wipe of personal devices upon termination of employment.

## Violations of policy

Employees/Contractors who have not received authorization in writing from Health Note management and who have not provided written consent will not be permitted to use personal devices for work purposes. Failure to follow Health Note policies and procedures may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
