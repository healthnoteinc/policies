## 30.1 Overview

1. Health Note internet, email, and other systems/infrastructure is for business use. The intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use Policy are not to impose restrictions that are contrary to Health Note’s established culture of openness, trust, and integrity. Health Note is committed to protecting employees, partners, customers, and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.
2. Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to cloud infrastructure, virtual systems, computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network accounts providing electronic mail, web browsing, etc., are the property of Health Note. These systems are for the business purposes and interests of our company, clients, and customers in the course of normal operations.
3. Access to Health Note’s IT systems is controlled by the use of User IDs, passwords, and/or tokens. All User IDs and passwords are uniquely assigned to named individuals and consequently, individuals are accountable for all their actions on Health Note’s IT systems.
4. Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every Health Note employee and affiliate who deals with information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of every computer user to know these guidelines, and to conduct their activities accordingly.

## 30.2 Purpose

1. The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of Health Note resources, both physical and virtual.

Health Note has the right to monitor activity on its systems, including internet and email use, in order to ensure systems security and effective operation, and to protect against misuse.
4. Monitoring is carried out in accordance with audited, controlled internal processes.
5. It is the responsibility of the user to report suspected breaches of security policy immediately to management, the IT department, or the Security Officer.
